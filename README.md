# Reversi

Reversi Game

# Overview

This repository contains the Java implementation of the Reversi game (also known as Othello) as part of the CS24011 lab assignment. The main objective of this assignment is to implement a better move selection function using the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning for the computer player.

# Contents

Othello.java: Main game class.
BoardState.java: Contains the game logic and board representation.
MoveChooser.java: The class you need to modify to improve the computer player's moves.
Move.java: Represents a move on the Reversi board.
README.md: This file.
Getting Started

# Prerequisites
Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.

# Compile the Java files:
javac Othello.java

# Run the game:
java Othello

# Playing the Game
The game starts with a human player (black) against the computer (white).

If you have no legal moves, click anywhere on the board to pass the turn to the computer.
To start a new game, close the window and re-run the program.
